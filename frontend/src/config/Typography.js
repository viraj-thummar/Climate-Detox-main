Furthermore, Carbon taxes are fees levied on emissions from fossil fuels to discourage their usage and encourage the development of renewable energy sources. When you acquire a certain amount of carbon credits you can not be held liable for the equivalent tonnes of carbon emission produced by you. Hence, carbon credits can certainly hold their own against the carbon tax.</p>,

The majority of greenhouse gases emitted by human activity are carbon dioxide and methane. It is also one of the major reasons for climate change as it causes more heat to be enclosed in the atmosphere resulting in an overheating planet, that is, global warming.
